# MOA_course_project
Machine learning project with multiple steps. THe goal of the project goes as follows
1) training a classification and regression models to predict sensitivity for leukemia cell lines to anti-cancer drug Nilotinib. Cell line data was downloaded from two cancer cell archives, CCLE and GDSC. 
2) Selecting most important biomarkers based on supervised models.
3) Performing clustering on TCGA leukemia data based on the selected biomarkers.
4) Comparing the gene expressions of found clusters to gene expression of high and low sensitivity cell line data to deduce, if some clusters of patiens would more       benefit from the treatment
